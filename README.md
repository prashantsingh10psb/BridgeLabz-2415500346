# 🚀 BridgeLabz-2415500346-Training  
### 🧠 Java Learning Log  

This repository documents my **Java learning journey** during the **BridgeLabz Training Program**.  
Each folder or branch focuses on a specific Java concept, progressing from the fundamentals to advanced topics like **Functional Interfaces**, **Lambda Expressions**, **Collections**, and **Exception Handling**.

## 🌿 Repository Structure  

Each folder represents a key Java learning module:  

| Folder Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `FunctionalInterfaces` | Covers Functional Interfaces, Default/Static methods, and Lambda usage |
| `OOPs` | Focuses on Object-Oriented Programming — classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation |
| `Collections` | Explores the Java Collections Framework — List, Set, Map, and Queue implementations |
| `WrapperClass` | Demonstrates Wrapper Classes, Autoboxing, and Unboxing |
